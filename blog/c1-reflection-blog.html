  <h1>Reflection</h1>

  <p>
    EDA seems like the answer to all the problems i had with traditional study.
    What i have gathered is that EDA is all about the students and how they learn and embracing everyones opinions
    questions and answers, so everyone grows together. There also seems to be a strong focus on quality and doing the best of our abilities.
    I see myself being nervous at first engaging with everyone but as time goes on i think ill fully embrace it and become a vocal part of the team and culture.
    my expectations havent changed its all that i thought it would be. Im very excited to participate in this kind of learning enviroment i wish all of my studies could have had the same values,
    I 100% am soooooo nerous, but i have an equal amount of excitment if not more!!
