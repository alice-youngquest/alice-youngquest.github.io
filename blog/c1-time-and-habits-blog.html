  <h1>Time and Habits</h1>

  <p>
    unfortunately this week i was unable to implement any of the timebox/habit techniques as
    i was still working fulltime. This seems like a horrible excuse right? your probably thinking "thats the perfect time to implement these ALICE"
    but here i am on the sunday doing all my work. so as i was reading through the different techniques a few really hit me good and it got me thinking about what i need to change.
    i found the reading on "the habits of successful people: they have a growth mindset" extremely interesting and its something i definitely want to apply to my everyday life.
    i have always believed that success was based on attitude and had never thought that if you proved your ability first then confidence would grow from there! it seems really basic
    and right when you actually think about it, how have we not all grown up with this mindset? i also found the timebox methods interesting but am a little skeptical but will definitely be experimenting with
    it this week, i think ill try the "pomodoro technique".
