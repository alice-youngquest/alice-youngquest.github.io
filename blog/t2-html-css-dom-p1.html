  <h1>html-css-dom</h1>

  <h2>can you think of an analogy to represent HTML, CSS and the DOM? </h2>

  <p>
  Being a girly girl i like to think of these things in reference to my wardrobe. The HTML is my structure, its the wardrobe everything gets placed in its the coat hangers.
  CSS is the clothing placed on the coat hangers to make my wardobe more me. Then the DOM is me looking into my wardrobe interpreting where everything is, what it is.
