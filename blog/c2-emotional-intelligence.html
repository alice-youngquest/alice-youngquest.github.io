  <h1>Emotional intelligence</h1>

  <h2>What learnings did i take from the chapter?</h2>
  <p>
    First off i really didnt think that chapter would be so interesting, my initial thoughts were... "I cant believe they are making me read this".
    BUT it was so enlightening and everything kinda just clicked for me. I particularly enjoyed the part talking about "response flexibility". Its something my friend and i were talking about the other day
    saying its something i should practice in my everyday life, if im to be completely honest i do have a quite short fuse. So being aware of yourself and taking those few seconds before automatically jumping into the deep end is definitely something i want to train myself to do!
    I also learned that having a more caring, optimistic way of teaching or encouraging people is more effective than being forceful and and just uninterested in the person.
    I enjoyed that the chapter was about developing skills to be a better/above average version of yourself and who wouldnt want to aspire to be better?

 <h3>How did i find the two minutes of mindfulness</h3>
 <p>
   This is something iv always done when im stressed, ill just lay down and look at the ceiling for a couple of minutes thinking about nothing really (or trying not to atleast!).
   But this isnt really something iv tried doing everyday... so having done this for the last week has been different! First off i can say it was a struggle to actually make myself do it, i would keep putting it off cause i felt like i had no reason to do it.
   So this is where i needed to change my mindset i decided id do it at the sametime every day i choose 9pm cause im always definitely home then. I realised that having this 2minutes set aside everyday just to breathe and apreciate made me calmer as a person.
   Im laughing at myself right now cause i never thought id say this but it really made me appreciate everything that i had done or seen that day and i felt happier for it. I think this is definitely something i want to carry on with.
